## Doing the Cryptopals challenge with .net core

I am trying to do the Cryptopals Challenge using .net core.


## Motivation

I am doing it so that I can get a little experience working with .net core. I wanted to do a little of the following: 

1. Solve the Cryptopals challenges
2. Work on doing unit testing
3. Continuos Integration seemed cool so every time I do a publish I have circle ci check that tests always run. 
4. (still being implemented) I wanted to keep track of code coverage so i am doing that too



## Build status
CircleCI says that all my tests are: 

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/smwentum/CryptopalsChallenge.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/smwentum/CryptopalsChallenge)



## Tech/framework used
.net core, xunit


## Code Example
This is just me playing around eventually this should have all the code to do the Cryptopals challenges but I am still working on in

## Installation
just pull down the code and open in visual studio 2017 community edition (what i am using ) and run the tests

## How to use? 
This probably isn't for use, and i guess i will make it private after i finish it.
